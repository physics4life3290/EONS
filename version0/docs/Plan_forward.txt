    In this document, we will discuss the abstract timeline of the physics we would like to add to our simulation.
We will also discuss what we have, the state of the code, and our potential direction, moving forward. We can start
with discussing the state of the code.

The State of the Code: 05/02/2025

    As a Most Viable (working) Product, we have coded pressureless free fall. We then added a few tweeks 
(Lane Emden, interpolation) and modularized the code, bridging in the numerical methods from A.R.C. 
(Algorithms for Realistic Computation, our other project). From there we produced a data storage protocol and a 
complementary plotting tool to dissect the file. 

    With a working product, we checked the behavior of our solutions. We saw that as time progressed, density 
increased at the center of the polytrope and the gravitational well became deeper. The velocity profile remained
negative, and with rough inspection, one can see that (or even code a plot of) our total energy shows the object
is bound. These behaviors indicate proper implementation of physics, boundary conditions, and algorithms.

    The next logical step was to add in pressure. Introducing thermal effects at the simplest level by creating
an isothermal process. We chose an ideal gas equation of state, and programmed the momentum equation to take account
for these effects. When we allowed the program to evolve our initial model, we saw a discrepancy between the 
isothermal and pressureless collapse. 

    The isothermal object developed a positive velocity towards the center of the simulation. This shouldnt happen 
and was indicative of mistreatment of the boundary conditions. We made the repairs to the inner boundary condition for
both velocity and pressure. This fixed the positive velocity that was developing, however, we now have an Inf that 
appears two points from the end of our velocity array after one time step. This needs investigation. We will start by 
looking at the input for the variables in the calculation, there is clearly a division by zero, or the value is being 
rewritten.  

    With this snag, we decided to take a step back and make sure that the physics within our pressureless free fall
was sound. We started by checking mass conservation. We saw that with 100 zones, between the first and second time steps that we 
lost 0.03% of the mass. When we increased our zones to 1000 we saw that we are loosing 0.00129% per step. We are using 
the most basic Finite Difference Methods so this loss is perfectly acceptable, and its convergence towards stability implies
correct implementation of the physics. We want our loss to be at the level of machine precision, such that numerical diffusion
is as small as possible.

    There appears to be an issue in how energy and or temperature is being calculated within the evolution of the polytrope.
We try evolving this object for 10 steps only, and we find that the temperature goes negative at step 8. This causes the internal
energy to go negative. Since internal energy is the sum of kinetic and thermal, this value should always be positive. This does 
not require a check like density, because the value that it goes negative is opposite. Setting this value to 0 would not be
physical as the central internal energy is non zero at the center of the polytrope.

The following is a listing of the order in progression through which EONS will follow to become AEONS.

    i) Pressureless Free Fall Collapse
    ii) Isothermal Collapse
    iii) Adiabatic Collapse
    iv) Advanced Equation of State (i.e. beyond degeneracy)
    v) Nuclear Reaction Network
    vi) Reactive Flow Equations
    vii) Rotation
    viii) Magnetic Fields
    ix) Radiation Transport
    x) Neutrino Transport

    A first wave of these may be "real" others may be approximations set with intention to revisit later (transport...). The size
of this list, and its order, may change as well. Since the focus is reactive flows in astrophysics, we want all sources of mixing, 
from collapse itself, to turbulence, to rotation.

The following is a list of the order in progression through which ARC will implement algorithms to keep up with EONS.

    i) Richtmyer Method
    ii) Godunov's Upwind Scheme
    iii) Piecewise constant/linear/parabolic
    iv) WENO

    This list is subject to change as we progress further.

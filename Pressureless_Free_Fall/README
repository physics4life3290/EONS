Overview

This MVP demonstrates a spherically symmetric gravitational collapse simulation built using the 
E.O.N.S. numerical framework. It combines a Lane-Emden density profile, finite-difference methods, 
and iterative time integration to model self-gravitating hydrodynamics in 1D.

Key Features
Lane-Emden Initialization: Generates initial density profiles for polytropic spheres.

Spline Interpolation: Downsamples high-res initial profiles to a working grid.

Self-Gravity Solver: Solves Poisson's equation using a spherical tridiagonal matrix.

Hydrodynamics: Updates density and velocity via finite-difference flux-conserving schemes.

Adaptive Timestep: Ensures stability via CFL-like condition.

Output: Saves snapshots to an HDF5 file for post-processing.

Requirements
Julia 1.x

Packages:
